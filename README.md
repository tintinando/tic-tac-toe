# Tic Tac Toe Project

This is a tic tac toe game like many others, with the particularity that it is made with both Vanilla JS, React and Vue. Both frameworks share the same library that handles the game logic.

Instead of the typical cross and circle symbols, choose randomly from various icons to make it more natural.
Design is responsive and respects the browser's night mode.
